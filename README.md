## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alessandro Ferrante, CS Engineer from Rome.

My interests are mainly in the field of AI and Machine Learning!

My latest project are:
* My own thesis project: [Custom ViT](https://github.com/aferrante99/Custom-ViT)
* A re-implementation of [SODA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17901), as a project for one of my NN courses: https://github.com/ElenaBianchini/NN-Project

Additionally, the projects pinned on this page were completed during my academic journey. :)
